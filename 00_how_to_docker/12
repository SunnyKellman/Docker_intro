Launch a mysql container as a background task. It should be able to restart on its
own in case of error, and the root password of the database should be Kerrigan.
You will also make sure that the database is stored in the hatchery volume, that
the container directly creates a database named zerglings, and that the container
itself is named spawning-pool.
